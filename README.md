# Taxis App

I am currently developing an Uber-inspired app, focusing solely on the front-end as a practice project to enhance my skills. This project is still a work in progress, as I continuously refine the user interface and add new features to improve its functionality and visual appeal. I am using a free API for geodecoding, and all styles and components are handmade, with no libraries used for the UI, except for the map.
